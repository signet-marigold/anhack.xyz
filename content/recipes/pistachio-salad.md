1 9oz cool whip or Rich (brand) whip cream (thawed)  
1 box pistachio instant pudding  
1 can crushed pineapple (juice included)  
1 1/2 cup small marshmallows  
1/2 cup chopped nuts (optional)  

Mix all ingredients together  
Refrigerate 2 hours before serving  

Optional - Pour in mold or 8"x8" baking dish.  

Bridget puts in about half the bag of small marshmallows  

If you find an 18oz cool whip, take what looks like half the tub of cool whip
