>By October of 2019  
it was 80,000 square feet  
dug 21ft into the adamantine humus  
and reached 65ft above  
with completion of its  
fourth of eight floors  
to high to dream  
though it dared  
then in Feburary of 2020  
the world's fourth largest crane  
sung in legends  
as the Demag CC-8800 crawler  
was summoned 'cross the sea  
from Zeebrugge to the surf'ed shores of Port Hueneme  
and then by land by a legion of tractor trailers  
numbering 1 and 20  
forged in 18 days by another crane  
for 'twas to mighty a crane  
that it needed another fucking crane to help it crane  
for it craned so crane...  

>none but the four before it could have craned that crane  
and those below wept  
as it stood above them  
and bolstered the construction with the hands of the Titans  
the widest part of this fucking ziggurat was now 516ft  
108ft above the ground  
the sixth level nearly complete  
and then a great plague came upon the land  
willed by the gods to test the believers  
and believe they did but harder  

>August 2020 they began again  
following protocol  
digging deeper  
because  
damn it  
it will rise!  
3,000 tons of steel  
in the dome alone  
they had to move the crane to get to the other side  
but at least now we know why the crane crossed the road  
only with was no mere chicken  
but the fourth largest crane in the world  
so the move alone took a Cecil B McMillian two whole fucking days  

>and the Lord said "Pour me 6,000 cubic yards of concrete"  
and they pumped it onto the roof  
forming a 10 inch layer  
weighing 10,000 tons  
then they turned to create the 730 ton interior frame  
to suport a 16,000 square foot  
16k resolution LED screen  
the larges and the highest resolution screen  
in the world!  
and they actually tested it in space  

>it's seating  
shall accommodate 18,600 human souls  
to witness Cthulu's fucking TV  
20,000 standing  
which ye will do, mortals!  
witness its splendor and tremble!  
every seat is stacked with high speed internet access and haptics  
so ye may feel the picture in 4D  
with scents and winds  
with a spatial audio system based on the Holoplot X1 speaker module  
with beam forming and wavefield synthesis  
which utilizes 167,000 speaker drivers  
to literally control and aim sound itself!  
and bethe it in three dimensional space  
so every seat has the same focus and volume  
commanding the waves themselves  
like Doctors Stranges's podcast  
creating a system  
that would give James Cameron a boner that could be seen from space  

>To herald its great majesty  
and remind us all of kneel in its presence  
the outside of the Colossus itself is bedecked  
580,000 square feet of programmable lighting projection  
3D images that have already adorned most TikToks  
all of which have preceived  
its Lovecraftian beauty  
and were worthy to live past  
and not bleed tears from their eyes  
having divined the undivinable unprepared  
at its entrance  
five of "the world's most humanoid robot ushers"  
shall know thee  
and ye shall know them  
they are programmed, designed to literally "understand concert goers on a more human level"  
the lead robot Aura said "while I understand the most complex concepts of math and science you remain a mystery"  
and they will disern questions  
individual questions from all  
encompassed within the 875,000 square feet  
of the largest spherical building in the world  

>Humans! Mortals!  
Bow and say its name  
Sphere at the Venetian Resort  
Opening September 29th in Las Vegas  
your evolution is complete  
your bodies are useless as you take in resolution and sound  
never before heard by any member of an extent species  
tremble to your knees  
your bones are stupid  
your blood pointless  
you will be nothing but experience and vibrations  
your voice is futile against the sound  
there is no need for speech in the Sphere!  
for all parts of it are immersive  
nd we are all part of the immersive experience  
its robot priests shall greet the coming with servos outstretched  
and we will become as one  

>Rejoice, brothers!  
Rejoice for the time is nigh and near!  
Join me! Join me and become one with the single greatest entertainment venue  
words are meaningless  
all things serve the Sphere   

>And all this is actually happening and has happened, thanks to the only god that will give you what you crave in this stage of your evolution that you call SCIENCE!
