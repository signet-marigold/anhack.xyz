*Yuh* ok.. so i've got new radios.
I've had my yaesu for a while now but i needed some cheaper \*beate-up-able\* more field radios that i can take everywhere without worry of damaging the electronics or battery to weather or a hot car.
Whatever, they're burner handies.

oh there's one you should take note of... thats a **quansheng uv-k5(8)** running an openable chipset. with a little modification it can recieve from 
18 - 1300 MHz

Now it's filtering out of band is pretty poor but the hackable nature of the radio allows for so much!

Alright; From left to right we've got a 
- Baofeng uv-5r with a dualband SignalStuff SingalStick antenna
- Quansheng uv-k5(8) with a dualband Diamond SRJ77CA antenna
- Yaesu FT-65 with a dualband SignalStuff SingalStick antenna

Honestly now i've heard that the transmit on the quansheng is a little noisey so im exclusivly using it as a reciever only.
So i've got a cheap talker and a decent talker as well.
Good enough for now.



BYE
