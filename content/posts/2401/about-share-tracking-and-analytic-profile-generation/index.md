You may have noticed that some of your youtube links are a bit longer than you've seen before.

Here's whats going on.
Google along with other companies have figured out a way to track resource sharing outside of their platform.
That number at the end is sent back along with reference data courtesy of your browser in the form of user-agents and http reference fields.
So they can reliably *with a little guess-work* find what computer accessed that resource.

For example: here are some source ids i've collected from my friends discord server over the last month
