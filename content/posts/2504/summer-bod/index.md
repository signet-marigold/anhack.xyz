I'm going to max out all my stats istg

ok plan is im going to have a simple cardio and diet plan, mixed with some simple daily patterns.

im thinking something like this:

# Daily

## minimum:
- 10,000 steps a day
- 50 minutes low intensity cardio
- 50 situps
- 20 pushups
- 30 dips

## diet:
- 180 g protein
- quarter carbs
- quarter vegies
- half protein


# Oh and i wanna learn how to dance

that and doing things around the city

everything needs monies to work so im going to rob a bank every once and a while to top off.
